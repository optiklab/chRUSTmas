For our neural network library, we’ll build a classifier that can identify images of cats and non-cats. To simplify the process, I have converted these images into 3-channel matrices of size 64 x 64, which represents the image resolution. If we flatten this matrix, we obtain a vector of size (3 x 64 x 64), which is equal to 12288. This is the number of input features that will be fed into the network. Although we can make the network adaptable to different input feature sizes, let’s design it specifically for this dataset for now. We can generalize it further in the subsequent parts.
